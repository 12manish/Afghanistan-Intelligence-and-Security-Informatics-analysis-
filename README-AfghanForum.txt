This dataset is one of sixty-five forums collected from 2010-2012 by the Artificial Intelligence Lab to support its Geopolitical Web ("GeoWeb") Research project. GeoWeb investigated computational approaches for monitoring public opinion in regions of conflict, assessing country risk indicators in the social media of fragile or weakening states, and correlating these risk signals with commonly accepted quantitative geopolitical risk assessments. Each forum contains postings organized into threads that generally indicate the topic under discussion. Each posting includes detailed metadata such as date, member name, etc.  Collection sizes vary, with smaller forums containing a few thousand or a few tens of thousands of postings, and larger collections boasting hundreds of thousands to over a million postings. Languages include English, Arabic, French, Indonesian, Pashto, or Urdu, depending on the forum. Information regarding the focus of each forum is not recorded; they were collected for being of general interest, with discussions covering a wide range of topics.
